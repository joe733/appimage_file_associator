# Appimage File Associator

[AppImage](https://appimage.org/) as we know, is a next gen Linux software packaging üì¶ tool. It is distro independent üòÉ which means it can run on most of the thousands of Linux üêß distributions available online. Besides you can run it with single click üñ± that's intersting isn't it...? Gone are the days when PC üñ• users hit out at Linux distros' UX saying it difficult to even install ‚öôÔ∏è a simple application.

Embracing the change LibreOffice üíº the best Office 365 alternative recently launced it own version of AppImage. This version is amazing light and fast. It integrates everything ü§© a normal office user will expect. You can try it out from [here](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/appimage/).

### About this repo...

> There's a daemon which performs advanced tasks than this script. You can find it here: [appimaged](https://github.com/AppImage/appimaged) by [AppImage](https://github.com/AppImage).

Ususally an AppImage does not come included with file type association. In simple terms you may not be able to open a file direclty from a folder. For example if you have _only_ LibreOffice AppImage in your system a `.docx` or `.odp` file cannot be opened from a directory. Oh oh..üôÑ so what should I do?

To overcome this I've written a simple python script which makes things a lot easier. It will automatically associate file types with the respective AppImage. Currently this supports LibreOffice and I will add more as and when time permits.
